## How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Navigate to the Labels Directory**:
   - Open your file explorer and go to the `labels` folder within the project directory.

2. **Create a User Folder**:
   - Create a new folder named after the user. For example, if the user's name is `JohnDoe`, the folder should be named `JohnDoe`.
   - You can use images from the signup process or upload your own images to this folder.

3. **Add User Photos**:
   - Place two photos of the user in this newly created folder.
   - Name the images `1.png` and `2.png` respectively.

4. **Modify the Sketch.js File**:
   - Open the `sketch.js` file located in your project's root directory.
   - Locate the function `loadLabeledImages`.
   - Add the new user's folder name to the `labels` array. For example, add `"JohnDoe"` to the array.

5. **Run the Project**:
   - Use the command line to navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the project by going live.

6. **Testing the Setup**:
   - Open a web browser and go to the signup page of your application.
   - The system should now be able to differentiate between a fake picture and a real (live) picture of the user.
